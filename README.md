This is a game I'm working on in Oct 2017 for a Javascript module of my Web Developer bootcamp. I'm learning how to push to a remote repository as well, by doing this and writing this document. Original game by Ziad Saab at DecodeMTL.

Friday October 13 2017 changes:
* there are coins which add 10000 points to your score when you hit them.
* the cats' exhaust and tail do not kill you //DONE
* whenever an enemy's speed is greater than 0.5, they receive a special Skullcat sprite (no other special properties)
* animate the enemies and the falling coins with a spritesheet
* added a soundtrack and sound effects
* added a special gameover screen where everything fades out 
* added a restart button on the gameover screen
* you have 3 lives 
* added two popups: an "ouch" impact popup when an enemy hits you, and a "+10000" popup when you hit a coin.
* added a special dead player sprite with crossed out eyes
 

to do:
* add another level with harder difficulty?
* add more visual effects
* make a separate subclass of Enemy called SkullCat, with special properties. Maybe they'll take away all your lives at once.
* out of curiosity: Figure out why changing the || operator to an && operator in the enemy placing function will make the game jump.
* add lasers like Mike's
* add different kinds of weapons
